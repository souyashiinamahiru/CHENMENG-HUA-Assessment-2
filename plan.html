    <h1>CP1406/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> CHEN MENG HUA </p>
    <p><strong>Student ID:</strong> 14799000</p>

    <h2>1. Goal</h2>
    <p>
        The primary goal of the new website for <strong>100SMILES Dental Care</strong> is to expand the clinic's reach
        and increase the number of new patient bookings.
        Instead of just "providing information," the site aims to actively <strong>convert visitors into
            patients</strong> by showcasing the clinic's 30+ years of experience and comprehensive services (Implants,
        Orthodontics, Cosmetic Dentistry).
        It will serve as a digital hub to build trust, educate patients on preventative care, and streamline the
        appointment booking process.
    </p>
    <p class="muted"><em>(Based on client brief requirements: "enhancing our business's online presence and expanding
            our reach")</em></p>

    <h2>2. Success Evaluation</h2>
    <p>The success of the website will be measured by the following specific metrics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Increased Revenue:</strong> A direct increase in clinic revenue driven by more online appointment
            requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Booking Conversion Rate:</strong> Tracking how many visitors click the "Book Appointment" button or
            fill out the contact form (Target: 5% conversion).</li>
        <li><strong>User Engagement:</strong> Monitoring analytics to see if users are spending time reading about
            high-value services (e.g., Implants, Orthodontics), indicating successful patient education.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted"><em>(Revised to focus on revenue and business outcomes as per feedback)</em></p>

    <h2>3. Target Audience</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Who are they?</strong> The audience is broad, covering "all ages" from young children (first visits) to
        retirees requiring restorative care. They are primarily local residents of Razole (around 33 Fantail St) and
        surrounding suburbs.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What do they want?</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> They are looking for a trusted, experienced (50+ years combined experience)
            provider.</li>
        <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> They want easy access to location info, opening hours, and booking.</li>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive Care:</strong> They seek both routine check-ups and specialized treatments like
            cosmetic dentistry.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="muted"><em>(Derived from client description: "dental care provider for all ages... from young children to
            retirees")</em></p>

    <h2>4. Site Flowchart</h2>
    <p>
        The site will follow a <strong>Vertical Tree Structure</strong> to ensure logical navigation.
        <br><strong>Structure:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Home (Level 1)</strong>: The main entry point.</li>
        <li><strong>Level 2 Pages</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Services</strong> (Links to: Check-ups, Implants, Orthodontics)</li>
                <li><strong>About Us</strong> (History & Team)</li>
                <li><strong>Contact</strong> (Map & Booking Form)</li>
                <li><strong>FAQ</strong> (Common Dental Questions)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
        Note: Navigation will be flexible, allowing users to jump between "Services" and "Contact" easily (Flexible
        Navigation).
    </p>

    <h2>5. Wireframes</h2>
    <p>
        The layout will use a <strong>3-Column Design</strong> on desktop to present information clearly and avoid being
        "too text-heavy".
        <br><strong>Key Layout Features:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Header:</strong> Logo (Left) + Navigation Bar (Right).</li>
        <li><strong>Hero Section:</strong> Large welcoming image of a smiling patient + "Book Now" CTA button.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Area (Columnized):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Column 1: Preventative Care (Check-ups)</li>
                <li>Column 2: Restorative Care (Implants/Orthodontics)</li>
                <li>Column 3: Cosmetic Dentistry</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Footer:</strong> Address (33 Fantail St), Phone, Copyright.</li>
